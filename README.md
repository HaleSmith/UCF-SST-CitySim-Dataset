# UCF-SST-CitySim-Dataset


This dataset contains the drone data from seven intersections near the campus of the university of central florida. Each intersection has n minutes of recording, and the drone flight hight is 400 feets. The dataset contains the variables including frameNum, carID, boudingBoxXY, carcenterX/Y, boundingBoxLat/lon and carCenterLatlon.

The intersection of University Boulevard (9 lanes) and Alafaya Trail (9 lanes) is a large, signalized intersection at the entrance of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Due to the large volume of serviced vehicles, the intersection contains numerous vehicle-to-vehicle traffic conflicts including merge conflicts and turning movement conflicts. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 503 crashes in the intersection.

This location contains two consecutive signalized intersections as well as their connecting road segment. The two intersections are positioned on both ends of a large student garage at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Both intersections have permitted left-turn signal phases which lead to potential conflicts between southbound through traffic on the major road and left-turning vehicles heading for the garage. Furthermore, the connecting road segment contains the queue buildup for vehicles heading to the garage. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 57 crashes in this location.

The intersection of McCulloch Road and Seminole Avenue is a non-signalized intersection with a mid-block near the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Due to the intersection’s non-signalized nature and reliance on driver visibility for movement decision making, the intersection contains numerous turning movement potential conflicts. Conflicts between westbound through traffic on the major road and left-turning vehicles from the minor road as well as left-turning vehicles from the major road are frequently observed, especially when students rush from Seminole Avenue to the major road during school time. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 42 crashes in the intersection.

VR co-simulation
The Unity simulator and SUMO simulation are connected through the TraCI portal provided by SUMO, and real-time co-simulation is achieved. In the co-simulation mode, the road network in SUMO and the map in Unity are matched, and all the vehicles and other traffic participants will be synchronized in both software. When conducting driving simulator experiments, the vehicle generated by SUMO act as background traffic which simulates the real- world traffic flow, and the vehicles spawned by Unity are operated by the drivers. Hence, the drivers are interacting with vehicles in the real-world traffic flow.
