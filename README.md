# UCF-SST-CitySim-Dataset


This dataset contains the drone data from seven intersections near the campus of the university of central florida. Each intersection has n minutes of recording, and the drone flight hight is 400 feets. The dataset contains the variables including frameNum, carID, boudingBoxXY, carcenterX/Y, boundingBoxLat/lon and carCenterLatlon.

VR co-simulation
The Unity simulator and SUMO simulation are connected through the TraCI portal provided by SUMO, and real-time co-simulation is achieved. In the co-simulation mode, the road network in SUMO and the map in Unity are matched, and all the vehicles and other traffic participants will be synchronized in both software. When conducting driving simulator experiments, the vehicle generated by SUMO act as background traffic which simulates the real- world traffic flow, and the vehicles spawned by Unity are operated by the drivers. Hence, the drivers are interacting with vehicles in the real-world traffic flow.
