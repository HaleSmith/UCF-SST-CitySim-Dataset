The intersection of University Boulevard (9 lanes) and Alafaya Trail (9 lanes) is a large, signalized intersection at the entrance of the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Due to the large volume of serviced vehicles, the intersection contains numerous vehicle-to-vehicle traffic conflicts including rear-end conflicts and turning movement conflicts. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 503 crashes in the intersection.

## Co-Simulation Base Map

### Carla Base Map（University @ Alafaya）

University @ Alafaya 3D base map. The map is build based on GIS data using RoadRunner. The drone video area is carefully modeled by reconstructing the road geometry, signal lights and buildings. The region of the vicinity is also modeled roughly.

## Example Use Cases

### Co-Simulation Demo

The Unity simulator and SUMO simulation are connected through the TraCI portal provided by SUMO, and real-time co-simulation is achieved. In the co-simulation mode, the road network in SUMO and the map in Unity are matched, and all the vehicles and other traffic participants will be synchronized in both software. When conducting driving simulator experiments, the vehicle generated by SUMO act as background traffic which simulates the real- world traffic flow, and the vehicles spawned by Unity are operated by the drivers. Hence, the drivers are interacting with vehicles in the real-world traffic flow.
