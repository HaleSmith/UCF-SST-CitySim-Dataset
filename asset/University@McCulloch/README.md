The intersection of McCulloch Road and Seminole Avenue is a non-signalized intersection with a mid-block near the University of Central Florida in Orlando, Florida. Due to the intersection’s non-signalized nature and reliance on driver visibility for movement decision making, the intersection contains numerous turning movement potential conflicts. Conflicts between westbound through traffic on the major road and left-turning vehicles from the minor road as well as left-turning vehicles from the major road are frequently observed, especially when students rush from Seminole Avenue to the major road during school time. Between 2011 – 2022, there was a total of 42 crashes in the intersection.
